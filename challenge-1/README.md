# Challenge 1 - Responsive Design Challenge

## Goal

Modifying only `src/app.css`, make the preset HTML markup fully responsive. You have a bit of creative freedom with the layout, but please ensure the layout is responsive for mobile (<= 480px), tablet (481px - 768px), and desktop (>= 769px) screen sizes using those breakpoints.

## Judging Criteria

- Responsiveness of layout: 50%
- Subjective quality of layout: 30%
- Cleanliness and structure of CSS: 20%
